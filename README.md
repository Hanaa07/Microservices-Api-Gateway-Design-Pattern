### Key Components:

1. **Classes**:
   - **ApiGateway**: Acts as the central gateway.
   - **DesktopProduct** and **MobileProduct**: Represent different product views (desktop and mobile).
   - **ImageClientImpl** and **PriceClientImpl**: Concrete implementations for handling images and pricing.

2. **Interfaces**:
   - **ImageClient**: An interface for handling image services.
   - **PriceClient**: An interface for pricing services.

3. **Associations**:
   - **ApiGateway** is associated with:
     - `ImageClient` (optional, 0..1 cardinality).
     - `PriceClient` (optional, 0..1 cardinality).

4. **Realizations**:
   - `ImageClientImpl` realizes `ImageClient`.
   - `PriceClientImpl` realizes `PriceClient`.

5. **Diagram Metadata**:
   - The diagram is configured to auto-size elements and display features like package names, stereotypes, and visibility.

### Observations:
- This structure follows the **API Gateway pattern**, where the `ApiGateway` centralizes access to services such as `ImageClient` and `PriceClient`, abstracting the complexities of underlying services from the consumer.
- **Extension points** are clearly defined via interfaces, making the system open to future enhancements (e.g., adding new services).
